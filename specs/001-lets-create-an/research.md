# Research for Web Application for Daily Task Management and GitHub Activity Tracking

## Unknowns and Research Tasks

### Storage Solution
- **Research Task**: Investigate suitable storage solutions for a full-stack Next.js application that needs to store user tasks, GitHub repository configurations, and potentially cached GitHub activity data. Consider options like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, or cloud-based solutions (e.g., Firebase, AWS DynamoDB).

### Testing Frameworks and Strategies
- **Research Task**: Identify appropriate testing frameworks and strategies for a Next.js (React/Node.js) application with TypeScript. This should cover unit testing (frontend and backend), integration testing, and end-to-end testing. Consider Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, Playwright, Supertest.

### Performance Goals
- **Research Task**: Define realistic performance goals for the web application. This includes aspects like page load times, API response times, and UI responsiveness. Research industry best practices for similar applications.

### Constraints
- **Research Task**: Identify potential constraints for the web application, such as budget limitations, deployment environment restrictions, or specific compliance requirements.

### Scale/Scope
- **Research Task**: Determine the expected scale and scope of the application, including the number of concurrent users, data volume, and future growth potential. This will influence architectural decisions.

### GitHub Authentication Method
- **Research Task**: Research and recommend the most secure and user-friendly GitHub authentication method for a web application. Options include OAuth 2.0 (recommended), Personal Access Tokens (for specific use cases), or GitHub Apps.

### Specific GitHub Activities to Track
- **Research Task**: Determine which specific GitHub activities are most relevant for tracking within a 9 AM - 5 PM work schedule. Consider events like pushes, pull requests (opened, closed, reviewed), issues (opened, closed, commented), and code reviews. Prioritize activities that directly reflect developer productivity and collaboration.

## Next Steps
- Consolidate findings for each research task.
- Make decisions based on research and document rationale.
- Resolve all 'NEEDS CLARIFICATION' markers.
