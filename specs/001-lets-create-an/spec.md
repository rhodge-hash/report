# Feature Specification: Web Application for Daily Task Management and GitHub Activity Tracking

**Feature Branch**: `001-lets-create-an`
**Created**: Monday, September 15, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "lets create an app from the contents of this working dir, A web application that helps you manage your daily tasks and track GitHub activity specifically for two chosen repositories, focusing on your 9 AM - 5 PM, Monday - Friday work schedule."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to manage their daily tasks and track GitHub activity for two specific repositories during their 9 AM - 5 PM work schedule, Monday to Friday.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user has configured two GitHub repositories and their work schedule (9 AM - 5 PM, Mon-Fri), **When** they log in, **Then** they should see their daily tasks and relevant GitHub activity for the configured repositories within their work hours.
2. **Given** the user has an active task, **When** they mark it as complete, **Then** the task should be updated as completed and removed from their active task list.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there is no GitHub activity for the configured repositories during the work schedule?
- How does the system handle API rate limits for GitHub?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to define their daily tasks.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to mark tasks as complete.
- **FR-003**: System MUST integrate with GitHub to fetch activity for two user-specified repositories.
- **FR-004**: System MUST filter GitHub activity to display only events occurring between 9 AM and 5 PM, Monday to Friday.
- **FR-005**: System MUST display a consolidated view of daily tasks and filtered GitHub activity.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a mechanism for users to configure their work schedule (start time, end time, working days).
- **FR-007**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How will the user authenticate with GitHub? OAuth, Personal Access Token?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific GitHub activities should be tracked (e.g., commits, pull requests, issues)?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents the individual using the application, with associated tasks, GitHub repository configurations, and work schedule.
- **Task**: A single item of work for the user, with attributes like description, status (e.g., pending, complete), and due date (optional).
- **GitHub Repository**: A reference to a GitHub repository, including its owner and name.
- **GitHub Activity**: An event from GitHub (e.g., commit, pull request, issue comment) with a timestamp and relevant details.
- **Work Schedule**: User-defined start time, end time, and days of the week for work.
