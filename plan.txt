  * Core Purpose: A web application that helps you manage your daily tasks and track GitHub activity specifically for two chosen repositories, focusing on your 9 AM - 5 PM, Monday
     - Friday work schedule.
   * Key Technology: Still a full-stack Next.js (React/Node.js) application with TypeScript, styled using Bootstrap and Material Design principles.
   * Main Features:
       1. Repository Configuration: You'll be able to specify two GitHub repositories (e.g., owner/repo-name) to monitor.
       2. GitHub Activity Tracking: The dashboard will display commits, pull requests, and issues created or updated within those two repositories, specifically filtered for your 9
          AM - 5 PM workday, Monday through Friday.
       3. Task Management: A simple, local task list will be integrated, allowing you to add, edit, and mark tasks as complete. These tasks will be stored in your browser's local
          storage for persistence.
       4. Configurability: The application will allow you to easily modify the monitored repositories and your working hours/days.
       5. GitHub Personal Access Token: To access repository data, especially for private repositories or to avoid API rate limits, you'll need to provide a GitHub Personal Access
          Token. I will guide you on how to set this up securely using environment variables.
   * Design & UX: A clean, intuitive, and responsive dashboard layout, making it easy to see your relevant activity and tasks at a glance.

  This approach allows for a focused daily workflow and provides the flexibility you requested.

✦ The end result will be a fully functional web application that you can run locally on your machine.

  Specifically, you will have:

   1. A complete Next.js project: This includes all the source code (TypeScript, React components, API routes) for the "Personalized GitHub Task & Activity Dashboard."
   2. A local web interface: When you run the application, you'll access it through your web browser. This interface will display:
       * Your GitHub activity (commits, PRs, issues) for the two configured repositories, filtered by your specified working hours (9 AM - 5 PM, Mon-Fri).
       * A section for your personal tasks, which you can add, edit, and mark as complete.
   3. Configuration options: You'll be able to easily update the GitHub repositories you want to monitor and manage your GitHub Personal Access Token.
   4. Instructions: I will provide clear steps on how to set up the project, install dependencies, configure your GitHub token, run the application, and access it in your browser.

  This will give you a personalized tool to help you stay on top of your daily tasks and repository activity.
